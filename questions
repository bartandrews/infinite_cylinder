- 0/1 vs. up/down for spinful Hubbard model
- 'poorly conditioned Lanczos warning' for Honeycomb implementation, and twisted boundary conditions
- systematic method to reduce norm_err? it doesn't depend on chi_max, sometimes even gets worse with larger chi?
- is the initial state of psi important? how to choose initial prodct state? why are answers dependent on initial state?
- difference between init_sites and init_terms in fermions_haldane.py
- is the code efficiently parallelized? parallelize for loops
- L=2*Ly in the paper. How can you adjust the number of unit cells in the y direction?
- how to optimize the code for HPC? large amount of cores / memory required? settings to tune?
- where to read the correlation length? middle bond?
