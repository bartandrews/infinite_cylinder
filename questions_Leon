Questions about the paper:

- How is the entanglement gap defined in Fig.2.b) ?
- "Entanglement grows linearly with cyclinder circumference" (page 2) ?
- how is the subband filling defined ?
- is LLL split into p subbands always ?

General questions:

- Hermitian Hamiltonian for NN hopping on honeycomb lattice in Landau gauge
- simplest minimal example of FCI charge pumping (i.e. smallest possible chi, smallest unit cell, etc.)
- cheapest/easiest way to identify an FCI (is charge pumping the most robust method?)
- what does this warning mean? It appears sometimes after a long time trying to calculate charge pumping at a particular phi:

UserWarning: SVD with lapack_driver 'gesdd' failed. Use backup 'gesvd'

- does the ent_spec_flow neccesarily have to be symmetric?
- difference between MPS unit cell and magnetic unit cell?
