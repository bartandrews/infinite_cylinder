Questions about the paper:

- pg 1. "While the literature on FCIs focuses on models where a single low-lying flat topological band mirrors the physics of the lowest Landau level (LLL)". When is this true? What about the Hofstadter model studies?  
- How is the entanglement gap defined in Fig.2.b) ? "In the ES, we define the entanglement gap ∆ξ as the gap between the lowest two levels within the same quantum number and momentum sector".
- Fig 2.b) "The entanglement spectrum (ES){−logλi(ky)}". Is it at k=0 ?
- Fig. 3. Ly in units of magnetic length, how is Ly defined?
- Second dashed line in Fig.2.f) ?
- "Entanglement grows linearly with cyclinder circumference" (page 2) ? However, exponential with computational cost.
- how is the subband filling defined ?
- is LLL split into p subbands always ?

General questions:

- difference between MPS unit cell and magnetic unit cell?
- cheapest/easiest way to identify an FCI (is charge pumping the most robust method?)
- simplest minimal example of FCI charge pumping (i.e. smallest possible chi, smallest unit cell, etc.)
- what does this warning mean? It appears sometimes after a long time trying to calculate charge pumping at a particular phi:

UserWarning: SVD with lapack_driver 'gesdd' failed. Use backup 'gesvd'

- does the ent_spec_flow neccesarily have to be symmetric?
- Hermitian Hamiltonian for NN hopping on honeycomb lattice in Landau gauge
